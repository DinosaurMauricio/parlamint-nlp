# ParlaMint Exploration

This repo aims to explore the [ParlaMint](https://clarin.eu/parlamint) dataset, focusing initially on the Italian English version records (Further exploration could involve multilingual comparisons).

The goal is to understand the dataset and prepare for future tasks. Some ideas to explore include sentiment, stance detection, or other aspects of parliamentary language.

## Todo âœ…

- [x] Understand dataset structure and metadata
- [x] Build a simple interactive dashboard to explore the data

  - Note: Still WIP but moved to [parlamint-visual-dashboard](https://github.com/DinosaurMauricio/parlamint-visual-dashboard)

- [ ] Train initial model using a pretrained LLM (e.g., RoBERTa)
- [ ] Experiment with sentence embeddings for faster and simpler training
